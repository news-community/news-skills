"""
local_news_api.py, a READ-ONLY client for a Communities News newsroom's public API.
Example: Alaska News at alaskanews.com, whose API is https://alaskanews.com/api/v1.

For external creators (community journalists, bloggers, civic writers) to pull
published articles, meeting transcripts, public events, and prior-coverage RAG
into their OWN work. It never writes back to the platform: submitting content
back to the newsroom is a separate, editor-authenticated workflow, not this tool.

DEFAULTS to alaskanews.com, which is the only newsroom live on this platform
today. It is not limited to it: set NEWS_SITE and NEWS_COMMUNITY to point it at
another one. Nothing about a market is compiled in.

Terms of use are READ FROM THE NEWSROOM, per request, never assumed: robots.txt
`Content-Signal` first (contentsignals.org), then llms.txt. Every mode's output
carries them, because the person running this is republishing someone else's
reporting, and the attribution is the consideration for using it. If the terms
cannot be read, the output says so instead of inventing them.

## HATEOAS: every output points onward

The API and this client both follow a HATEOAS discipline: every response tells you
where to go next, so no external map is needed.

- CONSUMING the server's: API responses carry a `next_steps` array
  (`{rel, method, href, description}`). Non-JSON output surfaces them; `--json`
  passes them through in the payload for machine consumers.
- EMITTING our own: every mode ends with prioritized Next steps (with the WHY),
  the related modes, and a See also. No dead ends. Errors carry recovery paths.

## Auth: your own key, and only what it reaches

Each user supplies their OWN `cn_` key (env `COMMUNITIES_NEWS_API_KEY`, or the legacy
`NEWS_DESK_API_KEY` / `ALASKA_DESK_API_KEY`, or a `.env.local`
next to this script). `digest`, `topics` and `tags` need none; `search`/`angles`/`article`/`transcript`
/`events`/`rag`/`communities` need a valid key. `check` reports what YOUR key can
reach by ASKING the server: `GET /api/v1/me` returns a `reachability` block
derived from the platform's own router, so this client no longer carries a
hand-written copy that could go stale. It separates `session_auth_only` (no key
of any role reaches it, so there is nothing to request) from `requires_role` (a
membership you could be granted), which is the distinction a bare 401 destroys.

## Discovery: the five Ws (angles mode)

`angles` scaffolds the five-Ws investigative method for a READ-ONLY consumer. That
method has two modes: MATCHING (rank related coverage) is the server's job and stays
there; DISCOVERY (fix two Ws, expand the rest) is a human workflow of chained
searches, which a thin client CAN scaffold. `angles` fixes two Ws (an intent) and
runs the one framed search that intent implies, then hands back the nested-expansion
plan as next-steps, so the journalist drives depth, not the key's rate limit. See
SKILL.md's "Working the story" section.

Auth + HTTP + env plumbing is inlined below; stdlib only, no dependencies.
